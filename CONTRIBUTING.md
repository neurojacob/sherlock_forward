# Contributor's Agreement

This code is licensed under an MIT [LICENSE](LICENSE).

# Contributing

When contributing to forward, it is important to properly communicate the
gist of the contribution. If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply
explaining this within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this
is a larger fix or Enhancement, it should be first discussed with the project
leader or developers.

Please note we have a code of conduct, described below. Please follow it in
all your interactions with the project members and users.

## Pull Request Process

1. Currently, all pull requests should go to the master branch.
2. Follow the existing code style precedent. This does not need to be strictly
   defined as there are many lines of examples.
3. Test your PR locally, and provide the steps necessary to test for the
   reviewers.
4. All changes must be documented in the README.md, and update the CHANGELOG.md.
5. The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be
   done by the project leader.


# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project leader. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of
an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers, contributors and users who do not follow or enforce the
Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions 
with their involvement in the project as determined by the project's leader(s).
